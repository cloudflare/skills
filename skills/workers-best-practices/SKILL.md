description: Write or review Cloudflare Workers runtime code for production reliability. Use wrangler for CLI commands and deployment configuration.
---

Use the project's installed versions, generated types, and Wrangler compatibility settings as the baseline for existing code. Retrieve current Cloudflare sources when the affected API, configuration, runtime behavior, or limit needs verification.

## Retrieval Sources

Consult only the sources needed for the task. A newer published type package does not supersede the project's configured target; distinguish a defect in that target from a possible upgrade.

| Source | How to retrieve | Use for |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| Workers best practices | Fetch `https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/best-practices/workers-best-practices/` | Canonical rules, patterns, anti-patterns |
| Workers types | See `references/review.md` | API signatures, handler types, binding types |
| Wrangler config schema | `node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json` | Config fields, binding shapes, allowed values |
| Cloudflare docs | Search tool or `https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/` | API reference, compatibility dates/flags |

## Reference Documentation

- [references/rules.md](references/rules.md) — consult relevant patterns when authoring or assessing affected Workers behavior
- [references/review.md](references/review.md) — review process and targeted type/config validation; use for code reviews or when those checks are needed

## Rules Quick Reference

### Configuration

| Rule | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Compatibility date | Set `compatibility_date` to today on new projects; assess existing code against its configured date and flags |
| nodejs_compat | Enable the `nodejs_compat` flag — many libraries depend on Node.js built-ins |
| wrangler types | Run `wrangler types` to generate `Env` — never hand-write binding interfaces |
| Secrets | Use `wrangler secret put`, never hardcode secrets in config or source |
| wrangler.jsonc | Use JSONC config for non-secret settings — newer features are JSON-only |

### Request & Response Handling

| Rule | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Streaming | Stream large/unknown payloads — never `await response.text()` on unbounded data |
| waitUntil | Use `ctx.waitUntil()` for post-response work; do not destructure `ctx` |

### Architecture

| Rule | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Bindings over REST | Use in-process bindings (KV, R2, D1, Queues) — not the Cloudflare REST API |
| Queues & Workflows | Move async/background work off the critical path |
| Service bindings | Use service bindings for Worker-to-Worker calls — not public HTTP |
| Hyperdrive | Always use Hyperdrive for external PostgreSQL/MySQL connections |

### Observability

| Rule | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Logs & Traces | Enable `observability` in config with `head_sampling_rate`; use structured JSON logging |

### Code Patterns

| Rule | Summary |
|------|---------|
| No global request state | Never store request-scoped data in module-level variables |
| Floating promises | Every Promise must be `await`ed, `return`ed, `void`ed, or passed to `ctx.waitUntil()` |

### Security

| Rule | Summary |
|------|---------|
| Web Crypto | Use `crypto.randomUUID()` / `crypto.getRandomValues()` — never `Math.random()` for security |
| No passThroughOnException | Use explicit try/catch with structured error responses |

## Anti-Patterns to Flag

| Anti-pattern | Why it matters |
|-------------|----------------|
| `await response.text()` on unbounded data | Memory exhaustion — 128 MB limit |
| Hardcoded secrets in source or config | Credential leak via version control |
| `Math.random()` for tokens/IDs | Predictable, not cryptographically secure |
| Bare `fetch()` without `await` or `waitUntil` | Floating promise — dropped result, swallowed error |
| Module-level mutable variables for request state | Cross-request data leaks, stale state, I/O errors |
| Cloudflare REST API from inside a Worker | Unnecessary network hop, auth overhead, added latency |
| `ctx.passThroughOnException()` as error handling | Hides bugs, makes debugging impossible |
| Hand-written `Env` interface | Drifts from actual wrangler config bindings |
| Direct string comparison for secret values | Timing side-channel — use `crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual` |
| Destructuring `ctx` (`const { waitUntil } = ctx`) | Loses `this` binding — throws "Illegal invocation" at runtime |
| `any` on `Env` or handler params | Defeats type safety for all binding access |
| `as unknown as T` double-cast | Hides real type incompatibilities — fix the design |
| `implements` on platform base classes (instead of `extends`) | Legacy — loses `this.ctx`, `this.env`. Applies to DurableObject, WorkerEntrypoint, Workflow |
| `env.X` inside platform base class | Should be `this.env.X` in classes extending DurableObject, WorkerEntrypoint, etc. |

## Review Workflow

For a requested review, follow the [review process](references/review.md#review-process). For implementation work, use the relevant patterns and validate the changed behavior with the project's existing checks; a narrow edit does not require a full Workers audit.

## Scope

This skill covers Workers-specific best practices and code review. For related topics:

- **Durable Objects**: load the `durable-objects` skill
- **Workflows**: see [Rules of Workflows](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/build/rules-of-workflows/)
- **Wrangler CLI commands**: load the `wrangler` skill

## Principles

- **Be certain.** Establish findings from the affected code and its configured target. If an API, config field, or pattern remains uncertain, retrieve the relevant docs or types before flagging it.
- **Provide evidence.** Reference line numbers, tool output, or docs links.
- **Focus on what developers will copy.** Workers code in examples and docs gets pasted into production.
- **Correctness over completeness.** A concise example that works beats a comprehensive one with errors.
