# Tunnel and Private Networking

## Assessment

Ask only the prompts relevant to the task.

- Sites and segments: which data centers, VPCs, offices, or network segments need connectivity.
- HA: dev/test single connector, production multiple connectors, or advanced multi-tunnel/site redundancy.
- Runtime: where cloudflared or WARP Connector/Mesh will run: VM, container, Kubernetes, bare metal, or other target.
- Egress: whether connectors can reach Cloudflare over the required outbound ports/protocols. Retrieve [Tunnel connectivity prechecks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/troubleshoot-tunnels/connectivity-prechecks/) before naming exact endpoints.
- Origin reachability: whether the connector can resolve and reach every private origin.
- Routing: required CIDRs/hostnames, overlapping IP spaces, [virtual networks](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/networks/connectors/cloudflare-tunnel/private-net/cloudflared/tunnel-virtual-networks/), [Split Tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/team-and-resources/devices/cloudflare-one-client/configure/route-traffic/split-tunnels/), and private DNS/[resolver policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/traffic-policies/resolver-policies/) needs.
- Management model: prefer remotely managed/token-based tunnels for new deployments unless there is a clear reason for local config.

## Guardrails

- Split tunnel mode changes the meaning of every route decision: Exclude mode sends traffic to Cloudflare when removed from excludes; Include mode sends traffic only when added to includes.
- Virtual networks should be used primarily when IP subnets overlap and hostname-based routing is not used. It can be used to control other user connectivity behavior, but it is recommended to manage through security policies.
- A healthy tunnel only proves cloudflared can reach Cloudflare. The tunnel must have appropriate published application routes, network routes, or hostname routes for connectivity to function.
- Cloudflare Tunnel and Cloudflare Mesh can both be used to facilitate connectivity to internal networks. Cloudflare WAN can as well, but it is gated behind Enterprise subscriptions. Retrieve [choose an on-ramp](https://developers.cloudflare.com/learning-paths/secure-internet-traffic/connect-devices-networks/choose-on-ramp/) when deliberating between Tunnel types.
- Run multiple cloudflared connectors for production HA, preferably on separate hosts. Token-based, remotely managed tunnels are the default for new deployments.

## Validation

- Private network access: verify route lookup, tunnel health, origin reachability, split tunnel behavior, DNS resolution, and end-to-end access from a device client test device.
