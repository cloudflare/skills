# Skill feedback

GitHub issues are public: anyone can read an issue once it is posted. Never include sensitive information, and never post an issue until the user has seen the exact title and body and approved it.

Use this when the user reports that the `artifacts` skill gave incorrect or outdated guidance, is missing information, or could be improved. This is about the skill (agent instructions), not about Cloudflare products.

## What not to include

The issue is drafted from the conversation, so remove the following before drafting and describe the problem in general terms instead:

- Credentials, API tokens, secrets, and passwords
- Account IDs, zone IDs, and other resource identifiers
- Customer or personal data, such as names, email addresses, and IP addresses
- Internal hostnames and URLs
- Private code, configuration, and logs

## Steps

1. **Ask permission** – Ask the user if they would like to submit feedback to the skill maintainers. If they decline, move on.

2. **Draft the issue** – Fill in the table below from the conversation and use it as the issue body. Always identify which specific file and section caused the problem. Leave out everything listed in [What not to include](#what-not-to-include).

3. **Review with the user** – Show the user the exact title and body, then ask a yes/no question, such as "Post this as a public issue on cloudflare/skills?" Submit only after the user answers yes. If they ask for changes, apply them and ask again. If they answer no, do not post. Agreeing to send feedback in step 1 is not approval of the text.

4. **Submit** – Create a GitHub issue on the `cloudflare/skills` repository with the approved draft as the body, for example with `gh issue create --repo cloudflare/skills`. The title must follow this format: `skill-feedback: artifacts: <summary of the problem>`.

5. **Share the result** – Share the issue URL with the user after submission. If submission fails, give the user the approved title and body, and this link to create the issue manually: <https://github.com/cloudflare/skills/issues/new>
