## Conversation flow

All `scripts/` paths in commands refer to the skill bundle root; resolve them there, while project inspection and configuration target the user's project.

The user pasted the prompt. You are in a multi-step dialog. Detect what you can, ask only when you have to, confirm before every irreversible step. Each numbered moment is one agent message. Items marked **[wait for user]** require a user response.

1. **Brief acknowledge.** One sentence: "I'll run Turnstile setup end to end. That's: check auth, scan the codebase, create the widget, embed it where visitor requests need verification, wire server-side siteverify, validate. Proceed?" **[wait for user]** Do NOT present a plan yet. Auth + scan come first.

2. **CLI check.** Spin's helper scripts use `curl` against `api.cloudflare.com`. Account enumeration requires either an explicit `$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` or a user-approved canonical absolute `WRANGLER_BIN` outside the project with exact `WRANGLER_VERSION`. Never use `npx`, `pnpm exec`, a package script, a project-local binary, or an unapproved executable for a credential-bearing command. Never install Wrangler automatically during the flow.

3. **Auth + scope probe (FIRST irreversible action).** Run `scripts/auth-probe.sh`. If account enumeration needs Wrangler, set `PROJECT_ROOT`, approved canonical `WRANGLER_BIN`, and exact `WRANGLER_VERSION` first. Branch on `status`:
   - `ok`: continue to Step 4. The script already picked the account (single-account token, or one matching `$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`).
   - `missing_token` or `missing_scope`: ask the user to create a token at https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens → Custom token → permission `Account.Turnstile:Edit` → include the target account in Account Resources. **Do NOT direct them to `wrangler login`** unless wrangler's OAuth scope includes `Account.Turnstile:Edit` (varies by wrangler version). Offer two ways to provide the token without chat, cleanest first:
     1. **Export + relaunch** (token enters neither chat nor shell history): `read -rsp 'Cloudflare API token: ' token; echo; export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="$token"; unset token`, then restart the agent from that terminal.
     2. **Save to file** (token in a user-only file): `umask 077; read -rsp 'Cloudflare API token: ' token; echo; printf '%s' "$token" > ~/.cf-turnstile-token; unset token`, then load it without printing it.
     Do not ask the user to paste the API token into chat. When auth is established, re-run `auth-probe.sh` and resume from Step 4.
   - `network_failure`: the probe could not reach `api.cloudflare.com`. Show the diagnostic (VPN/proxy, TLS interception, DNS). Do not treat this as a scope problem. Ask the user to fix connectivity, then re-run `auth-probe.sh`.
   - `upstream_failure`: the API returned an unexpected response (`http_code` non-4xx). Do not assume the token is bad. Show the code, ask the user to retry after a brief wait, and re-run `auth-probe.sh`.
   - `multiple_accounts`: the token covers more than one account and `$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is unset. Present the numbered `accounts` list. **[wait for user]** Then export `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<chosen>` and re-run `auth-probe.sh`.
   - `account_mismatch`: `$CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` is set but isn't one of the token's accounts. Show the `accounts` list and ask the user to either `unset CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` or set it to one of those IDs.

4. **Account selection.** If `auth-probe.sh` returned `ok` after a `multiple_accounts` round-trip, this is already done. Otherwise the script picked the single account silently and you continue to Step 5.

5. **Domain.** Always include `localhost` and `127.0.0.1`. For production, scan `package.json` `homepage`, `wrangler.toml`, `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, git remote. Confirm: "I'll register for `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `<domain>`. OK?" **[wait for user]** If no production domain is found, ask. Registering local and production domains on one widget is safe only when each backend deployment validates the exact frontend hostname returned by siteverify. Never include `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` in a production backend's expected-hostname allowlist.

6. **Codebase scan.** Detect three things silently:
   - **Frontend framework** (Next.js, Astro, SvelteKit, Hugo, vanilla, etc.) → drives the widget embed snippet.
   - **Backend handler location** (Express route, Next.js API route, Rails controller, Workers fetch handler, Pages Function, etc.) → drives the siteverify snippet.
   - **Existing CAPTCHA** (reCAPTCHA / hCaptcha) → switches Step 7 to migration mode.

7. **Insertion plan.** Show the candidate list with `[recommended]` / `[skip by default]` markers; ask the user to confirm (numbers, "all", "recommended", or a list). Assign each chosen surface a stable action such as `signup`, `login`, or `contact`. Actions must be 1–32 characters and contain only letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens. Show the action-to-handler mapping for confirmation. **[wait for user]** If an existing CAPTCHA was detected, present a migration plan instead (see [migration.md](migration.md)).

8. **Widget creation.** Prefer the approved Wrangler executable when its `turnstile widget` subcommand is available:

   ```sh
   WRANGLER_WRITE_LOGS=false WRANGLER_LOG=log WRANGLER_LOG_SANITIZE=true \
     "$WRANGLER_BIN" turnstile widget create "<name>" \
     --domain <d1> --domain <d2> ... --mode managed --json
   ```

   In a `set +x` subshell, capture the complete stdout JSON in one shell variable. Parse `SITEKEY` and a non-empty, non-whitespace `WIDGET_SECRET` with `jq`, then unset the response variable. If the approved Wrangler executable is missing or older than the Turnstile subcommand, use the same capture pattern with `scripts/widget-create.sh --account-id <id> --name <name> --domains <list> --mode managed`. Do not fall back after an authentication or API failure. Report only the sitekey. Never print the complete response or write the secret to disk except into the user's own secret store in Step 9.

9. **Wire the integration.** State the contract: "I'll embed the widget at each chosen surface and add a canonical siteverify call inside its existing handler. The handler will require `success === true`, the expected action, and an approved frontend hostname. The existing handler logic stays the same. The secret lives in your env as `TURNSTILE_SECRET`." Ask "yes" / "show". **[wait for user]** If "show", print unified diffs and ask again. Do NOT propose alternate behavior (mail delivery, custom backends).

   Read [integration.md](integration.md) for the canonical server-side siteverify implementation, secret destination checks, and frontend contract.

10. **Validation.** For a newly created widget, set `EXPECTED_DOMAINS_JSON` to the user-approved JSON array and run `(set +x; printf '%s' "$WIDGET_SECRET" | scripts/validate.sh --sitekey "$SITEKEY" --account-id "$ACCOUNT_ID" --expected-domains "$EXPECTED_DOMAINS_JSON")`, then unset `WIDGET_SECRET`. The validator reads the secret only from standard input and never writes it to disk or command arguments. For an existing widget, the [existing-widget flow](existing-widget.md) validates the retrieved secret before storing it. In both flows, exercise the actual protected backend with a fresh real Turnstile token, verify one successful request, then verify that replaying the token is rejected. If the backend cannot be run, report destination validation as pending and do not claim end-to-end success. **[wait for user if anything fails]**

11. **Persist skill.** Ask: "Save the Spin skill to `.claude/skills/turnstile-spin/SKILL.md` so I can reuse it on follow-up tasks?" Default yes. **[wait for user]** For an agent that supports directory-based skill bundles, run `scripts/persist-skill.sh --path <bundle-directory>/SKILL.md`. For a file-oriented rules target, install the hosted `prompt.md` directly instead; do not run `persist-skill.sh`.

12. **Final report.** Print the structured summary: what was created, what was validated, what to do next.
